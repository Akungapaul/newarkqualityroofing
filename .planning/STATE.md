## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9 phases derived from 101 requirements at comprehensive depth
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3/4 can parallelize (both depend on Phase 2 only)
- [Roadmap]: Content differentiation engine isolated as Phase 5 -- highest-risk component gets dedicated validation
- [01-01]: Zod 3.25.x used (latest 3.x stable) -- compatible with all planned schema work
- [01-01]: Tailwind v4 @theme tokens (not @theme inline) for full utility class generation
- [01-01]: Cormorant fonts loaded with weights 300-700 for full design flexibility
- [01-02]: Replacement-sub-pages trimmed to 15 (dropped TPO/EPDM Roof Replacement) to hit exactly 63 services
- [01-02]: All data validated at module level with z.array(Schema).parse() -- build crashes on invalid data
- [01-02]: Residential/commercial flags set on all 63 services
- [01-03]: City pages use "roofing-in-{city}-nj" slug pattern to avoid service slug collisions
- [01-03]: dynamicParams = false for strict 404 on unknown slugs
- [01-03]: Combo metaTitle has cascading truncation (full brand > abbreviated > none) to stay under 70 chars
- [01-04]: Server/client nav-data split (Approach B) -- layout.tsx calls nav-data functions on server, passes serialized props to client Header, preventing Zod from client bundle
- [01-04]: GitHub repo public at Akungapaul/newarkqualityroofing with Vercel auto-deploy connected
- [01-04]: Empty commit pattern for infrastructure-only tasks (deployment milestone)
- [02-01]: serviceGroups passed as prop to LeadForm (keeps Zod out of client bundle)
- [02-01]: PhoneNumber is a server component (reads env at build, no interactivity)
- [02-01]: Added !.env.example exception to .gitignore (.env* was too broad)
- [02-04]: CoreTemplate uses minimal switch (only about/contact cases) to avoid merge conflicts with parallel 02-05
- [02-04]: ContactPage calls getServiceMenuGroups() directly as server component (no prop-drilling needed)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- City-specific data (neighborhoods, building codes, weather) for 21 cities needs research before Phase 4
- Photo asset library (50-100 curated stock images) needs sourcing before Phase 9

### Phase 1 Deliverables (Complete)

- Next.js 16 with Tailwind v4 design tokens (forest green/copper/parchment), Cormorant fonts
- 63 services, 21 cities, 1,323 combos, 30 comparisons, 7 core pages -- all Zod-validated
- Slug registry with collision detection, catch-all [slug] dispatcher, placeholder templates
- Sticky header with mega-menu navigation, mega-footer with SEO links
- Live on Vercel: https://newarkqualityroofing.vercel.app (1,448 static pages)
- GitHub: https://github.com/Akungapaul/newarkqualityroofing

### Phase 2 Deliverables (In Progress)

- LeadForm component with useActionState, 4 validated fields, optgroup service dropdown
- SubmitButton with useFormStatus pending state

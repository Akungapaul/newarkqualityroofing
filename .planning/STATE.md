## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9 phases derived from 101 requirements at comprehensive depth
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3/4 can parallelize (both depend on Phase 2 only)
- [Roadmap]: Content differentiation engine isolated as Phase 5 -- highest-risk component gets dedicated validation
- [01-01]: Zod 3.25.x used (latest 3.x stable) -- compatible with all planned schema work
- [01-01]: Tailwind v4 @theme tokens (not @theme inline) for full utility class generation
- [01-01]: Cormorant fonts loaded with weights 300-700 for full design flexibility
- [01-02]: Replacement-sub-pages trimmed to 15 (dropped TPO/EPDM Roof Replacement) to hit exactly 63 services
- [01-02]: All data validated at module level with z.array(Schema).parse() -- build crashes on invalid data
- [01-02]: Residential/commercial flags set on all 63 services

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- City-specific data (neighborhoods, building codes, weather) for 21 cities needs research before Phase 4
- Photo asset library (50-100 curated stock images) needs sourcing before Phase 9
- Residential/commercial service classification for 63 services -- RESOLVED in 01-02
